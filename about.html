<h1>About Me🫶🌸🐾💻💕</h1>
<p>
💗💖💓💞💕💘💝🌸🎀Hi there! 
</p>
<p>
I'm a passionate aspiring software developer, currently diving deep into the world of code through my apprenticeship in IT - Application Development. 
I absolutely love programming — there's nothing quite like the thrill of solving a challenging bug or building something from scratch and watching it come to life. 💻✨</p>
<p>
Born and raised in Berlin, I'm still happily based in the heart of the city, in the vibrant and diverse neighborhood of Wedding. It's a place that perfectly matches my love for creativity, culture, and constant inspiration. 🌆🖤
</p>
<p>
Outside of tech, my world is shared with the most amazing people — my wonderful boyfriend Brian, and our two absolutely adorable dogs, Astra and Nebula. Whether we're going on long walks, cuddling up on cozy evenings, or simply enjoying each other's company, they bring so much joy and balance into my life. 🐾❤️
</p>
<p>
As a proud Scorpio, I bring passion 💅💐, determination, and a deep curiosity into everything I do — especially when it comes to learning, growing, and exploring the endless possibilities in the world of software development.
</p>
<p>
I'm excited for what the future holds and where this tech journey will take me next. 🚀
